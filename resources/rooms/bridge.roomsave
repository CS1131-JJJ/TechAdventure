NAME
Bridge 

DESC
Crossing into Hancock, your tires meet the icey lifeless body of the Portage lake lift bridge. The marred rust enveloped bridge forces you to slink between holes, leaving any mistake to be your instant demise. Skating to a stop, you finally make it across, leaving you with 2 seemingly identical roads, one stretching West towards Hancock, and the other East to Mt. Ripley.
