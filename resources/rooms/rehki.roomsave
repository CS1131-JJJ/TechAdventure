Rehki 
 
DESC
Rehki Hall is eerily silent. Your knife glints in the dim light as you push forward. In the center of the room a ray gun rests on a table, humming faintly. It may be a tool that could save your life. 

REQUIRED
2
You enter Rehki hearing the shuffle of feet and low growls. Without a weapon, you canâ€™t defend yourself as zombies emerge from the shadows. They overpower you in moments leaving you lifeless.
